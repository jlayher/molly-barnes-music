        I consider teaching music a passion and a calling, and I love getting to
        know my students as human beings with real lives, hopes, fears, and
        ambitions. My goal as a teacher--whether I am teaching music history,
        musicianship skills, or the violin--is to share my love of the subject
        such that my students are inspired to learn more and discover the joy
        that can come from a deep intellectual and emotional engagement with
        music.

        Below are excerpts from student evaluations of my teaching in
        music history and musicianship classes at Durham University,
        UNC-Greensboro, and UNC-Chapel Hill.
