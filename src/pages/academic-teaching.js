      <h1>Academic Teaching</h1>
      <p>
        I consider teaching music a passion and a calling, and I love getting to
        know my students as human beings with real lives, hopes, fears, and
        ambitions. My goal as a teacher--whether I am teaching music history,
        musicianship skills, or the violin--is to share my love of the subject
        such that my students are inspired to learn more and discover the joy
        that can come from a deep intellectual and emotional engagement with
        music.

        music history and musicianship classes at Durham University,
        UNC-Greensboro, and UNC-Chapel Hill can be viewed by HERE.

      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>
        My research primarily concerns issues of musical taste and the formation
        of cultural hierarchies in the West during the nineteenth century. My
        current book project (based on my PhD dissertation), tentatively titled
        Old World Harmony, New World Democracy: American Idealism and the
        European Musical Inheritance, 1830-1870, explores mid-nineteenth-century
        American perceptions of the relationship between Western art music and
        the ideal of democratic egalitarianism. Other research interests include
        the musical culture of German immigrants to the United States in the
        nineteenth century; music and social theory in the twentieth century,
        particularly the thought of Adorno and the Frankfurt School; 1960s
        psychedelic music in the U.S. and the U.K.; chamber music as a social
        phenomenon in the nineteenth century; and many other topics.
