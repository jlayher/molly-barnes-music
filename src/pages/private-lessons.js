        I have taught private violin lessons for many years, and my students
        have ranged in age from 3 to 60. My teaching style is traditional (i.e.,
        non-Suzuki), although I do frequently use Suzuki books as sources of
        repertoire.

        A successful student-teacher relationship depends on
        respect, trust, and both parties' determination to achieve specific
        goals, whether technical or musical in nature. I focus heavily on the
        fundamental issues of rhythm and intonation, which form the basis for
        excellent musicianship. I expect students to practice daily and to be
        ready for and open to new challenges.

        Currently I teach private lessons
        in piano and violin, in-home and in-studio, through Skylark Music School
        in Chapel Hill.
