The classes are very intriguing and I feel like I enjoyed every single class. It opened my eyes to many aspects of music, and I no longer just 'listen' to music, I try to analyze the instruments, the rhythm and look for themes. This class made me appreciate music even more, so much that I am considering establishing myself as a music minor. Ms. Barnes as our instructor was just fabulous. All of her sessions are so packed with new material that I didn't want to miss even one minute in class. She is also very supportive outside class, making time for all of us and answering all our questions with great patience. She is no doubt one of my favorite instructors.",

Seeing your passion for music really made me strive to understand and appreciate it more myself. You explained musical terms and background very well...I'm glad that you included other movements in art and major world affairs in your discussion of the music; it made clearer the context and times in which it was written. You graded everything really quickly (and fairly, perhaps even leniently), and I can't imagine the time it took…I think that overall your teaching abilities and methods are outstanding and I'm very glad that I had you as a TA...any music student would be very lucky to have you.",
